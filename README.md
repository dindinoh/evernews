Small utility to use Evernote as rss reader in CLI using Geeknote to communicate with Evernote.

Requires Evernote account (https://evernote.com/)
and Geeknote setup and ready (https://github.com/VitaliyRodnenko/geeknote)

Then change the line in the script that now says:
MYNOTEBOOK="1TOREAD"
to the Notebook in Evernote that you wish to use as the base for your reading/rss pleasure.

And then ... go!
